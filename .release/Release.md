_Changes for v 5.0.3_:
- `Android`: fix for MAUI interface defect that allows application to crash by pressing system Back button on the main page. Applicable, therefore, only to the main page;
- Fixed some bugs in settings storage;
- App now can show the best solution time and the longest chain without checking;
- The current unchecked solution will be discarded when exiting the app to avoid locking invalid values as checked;
- `Windows`: the application has been migrated to `.NET 9.0` from `.NET Framework 4.8.1`;
- `Android`: added the tip for the first start
